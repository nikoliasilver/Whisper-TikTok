Harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI's Whisper model, Whisper-TikTok effortlessly generates an accurate transcription from provided audio files, laying the foundation for the creation of mesmerizing TikTok videos through the utilization of FFMPEG. Additionally, the program seamlessly integrates the Microsoft Edge Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to lend a vibrant voiceover to the video. Opting for Microsoft Edge Cloud TTS API's voiceover is a deliberate choice, as it delivers a remarkably natural and authentic auditory experience, setting it apart from the often monotonous and artificial voiceovers prevalent in numerous TikTok videos.</p>"},{"location":"#streamlit-web-app","title":"Streamlit Web App","text":""},{"location":"#demo-video","title":"Demo Video","text":"<p>https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok/assets/74818541/68e25504-c305-4144-bd39-c9acc218c3a4</p>"},{"location":"#how-it-works","title":"How it Works","text":"<p>Employing Whisper-TikTok is a breeze: simply modify the video.json. The JSON file contains the following fields:</p> <ul> <li><code>series</code>: The name of the series.</li> <li><code>part</code>: The part number of the video.</li> <li><code>text</code>: The text to be spoken in the video.</li> <li><code>outro</code>: The outro text to be spoken in the video.</li> <li><code>tags</code>: The tags to be used for the video.</li> </ul> <p>Summarizing the program's functionality:</p> <p>Furnished with a structured JSON dataset containing details such as the series name, video part number, video text and outro text, the program orchestrates the synthesis of a video incorporating the provided text and outro. Subsequently, the generated video is stored within the designated <code>output</code> folder.</p> Details  The program conducts the **sequence of actions** outlined below:  1. Retrieve **environment variables** from the optional .env file. 2. Validate the presence of **PyTorch** with **CUDA** installation. If the requisite dependencies are **absent**, the **program will use the CPU instead of the GPU**. 3. Download a random video from platforms like YouTube, e.g., a Minecraft parkour gameplay clip. 4. Load the OpenAI Whisper model into memory. 5. Extract the video text from the provided JSON file and initiate a **Text-to-Speech** request to the Microsoft Edge Cloud TTS API, preserving the response as an .mp3 audio file. 6. Utilize the OpenAI Whisper model to generate a detailed **transcription** of the .mp3 file, available in .srt format. 7. Select a **random background** video from the dedicated folder. 8. Integrate the srt file into the chosen video using FFMPEG, creating a final .mp4 output. 9. Upload the video to TikTok using the TikTok session cookie. For this step it is required to have a TikTok account and to be logged in on your browser. Then the required `cookies.txt` file can be generated using [this guide available here](https://github.com/kairi003/Get-cookies.txt-LOCALLY). The `cookies.txt` file must be placed in the root folder of the project. 10. Voila! In a matter of minutes, you've crafted a captivating TikTok video while sipping your favorite coffee \u2615\ufe0f."},{"location":"#web-app-online","title":"Web App (Online)","text":"<p>There is a Web App hosted thanks to Streamlit which is public available, just click on the link that will take you directly to the Web App.</p> <p>https://convert.streamlit.app</p>"},{"location":"#local-installation","title":"Local Installation","text":"<p>Whisper-TikTok has undergone rigorous testing on Windows 10, Windows 11 and Ubuntu 23.04 systems equipped with Python versions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.11.</p> <p>If you want to run Whisper-TikTok locally, you can clone the repository using the following command:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok.git\n</code></pre> <p>However, there is also a Docker image available for Whisper-TikTok which can be used to run the program in a containerized environment.</p>"},{"location":"#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>To streamline the installation of necessary dependencies, execute the following command within your terminal:</p> <pre><code>pip install -U -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>It also requires the command-line tool FFMPEG to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:</p> <pre><code># on Ubuntu or Debian\n\nsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install ffmpeg\n\n# on Arch Linux\n\nsudo pacman -S ffmpeg\n\n# on MacOS using Homebrew (&lt;https://brew.sh/&gt;)\n\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\n# on Windows using Chocolatey (&lt;https://chocolatey.org/&gt;)\n\nchoco install ffmpeg\n\n# on Windows using Scoop (&lt;https://scoop.sh/&gt;)\n\nscoop install ffmpeg\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that for optimal performance, it's advisable to have a GPU when using the OpenAI Whisper model for speech recognition.
